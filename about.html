      <p id="aboutMe">
        A 3rd year Computer Engineering student with a Mathematics Minor with a strong focus on
        software. Ever since I wrote my initiation "Hello, World!" function in C, I knew programming
        was my passion. That may sound gimmicky, but writing code made me feel something I haven't
        felt before- there was a whole world of possibilities and I was only learning how to do a
        simple "Print to Console". When I started to move up learning more mathematics, I felt there
        was so much you can do with the combination- hence why I added a Mathematics Minor.

        </br>
        Here I am years later, studying software and hardware and how computers can interact to
        form amazing creations and move technology to new levels:
        </br>
        I want to be a part of that world.
